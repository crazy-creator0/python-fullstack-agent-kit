# Universal Language Engineering

This skill is language-agnostic. Apply it to the language(s) actually present in the task and repository; do not treat placeholders or examples as literal language names. It is the shared baseline for all supported languages, not a claim that the project uses one language or that every language needs a separate skill.

## Inspect first
- Inspect nearby source, public APIs, project configuration, dependency manifests, build scripts, tests, and established conventions before choosing an implementation.
- Identify all relevant languages, frameworks, runtimes and version constraints, package managers, and available verification commands. Polyglot repositories may require more than one toolchain.
- Follow the repository's conventions; do not assume a tool, dependency, or skill exists just because it is familiar.
- Check existing imports and dependency relationships before moving code. Preserve clear dependency direction and avoid introducing cycles.

## Implementation
- Prefer the smallest clear change that solves the requested problem. Avoid speculative abstractions, unnecessary dependencies, and unrelated refactors.
- Use idioms and standard-library capabilities appropriate to the detected language and version.
- Keep names clear, responsibilities cohesive, and control flow straightforward.
- Use types, schemas, or explicit contracts where they improve correctness and maintainability; do not add noisy annotations that conceal uncertainty.
- Handle expected failures specifically. Do not swallow errors, silently hide failures, or fabricate successful defaults.
- Manage resources and lifetimes explicitly using the language's established mechanisms (for example, scoped cleanup, disposal, or context management).
- Avoid hidden global state, unsafe shared mutable state, surprising default values, and premature abstraction. Make state ownership and side effects clear.
- Respect API compatibility, security boundaries, secrets, privacy, and user-owned changes.
- Follow the project's established formatting, linting, typing, build, testing, and packaging conventions where relevant.

## Testing and verification
- Derive checks from the repository's actual toolchain: focused tests first, then relevant broader tests, lint, type checks, builds, or static analysis when available.
- Test behavior, important edge cases, and regression risks. Use mocks at external boundaries when appropriate, not as a substitute for testing the behavior itself.
- If a command or toolchain is unavailable, investigate a reliable alternative when useful and state the limitation honestly.
- Report only checks actually run and their observed outcomes.

## Specialist guidance
Use a language-, framework-, or domain-specific skill only when it adds concrete, relevant guidance beyond this baseline. Do not load a specialist that merely repeats this guidance. A missing specialist skill never means a language is unsupported; use repository evidence and reliable project documentation to proceed.
