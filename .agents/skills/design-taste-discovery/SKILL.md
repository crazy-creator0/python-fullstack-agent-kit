# Design Taste Discovery — Ask Before Choosing

## When to use this skill
Use for new websites, landing pages, UI redesigns, component styling, interactive visuals, animation, canvas effects, 3D scenes, or other tasks where visual taste materially affects the result. Do not use it for backend-only or non-visual tasks.

## Principle
**The user's taste comes before the tool list.** Never pick Aceternity UI, Canvas UI, Spline, VGPU, or another design library simply because it is listed in the kit. First understand the look and feel the user wants, then shape a plan and suggest only the skills/tools that fit.

## Step 1 — inspect what the user has already told us
Before asking a question:
- Read the user's brief and inspect any images, screenshots, URLs, brand references, moodboards, or existing UI they shared.
- Inspect the existing project, design system, framework, components, styles, and dependencies if available.
- Capture stated preferences, target audience, required content, device constraints, accessibility needs, and performance limits.
- Do not ask the user to repeat information they already gave. A reference image is meaningful evidence of taste; describe the visual cues you infer and flag ambiguity instead of pretending to know everything.

## Step 2 — ask one concise taste question when needed
If the direction is still unclear, ask one conversational question before designing or coding. Invite a reference and offer a few easy-to-understand examples, not a long questionnaire.

Example:
> Before I plan the UI, what visual vibe do you like? For example: clean/minimal, editorial and typography-led, premium dark with subtle glow, colorful/playful, or immersive 3D. A screenshot or website you like is also enough. Do you prefer subtle motion or a more animated experience?

Adapt this to the project. Do not force the user to choose from a fixed list. Ask about budget, licensing, strict performance, or browser support only when those constraints materially affect the recommendation.

## Step 3 — translate taste into a plan
Briefly reflect back:
- **Visual direction:** style, density, typography, color, contrast, depth, and motion.
- **User experience:** audience, primary action, page structure, responsive behavior, and accessibility.
- **Implementation approach:** keep the existing framework/design system when suitable; choose the smallest set of components/tools that match the goal.
- **Relevant skills/tools:** only the skills and optional libraries justified by the direction and actual project stack.
- **Trade-offs:** explain meaningful impacts such as dependency size, loading time, browser/GPU support, editing effort, licensing, or maintenance.

For a substantial new UI or a new third-party dependency, show the plan and ask for approval before implementing it. For a small focused change in an established design system, a brief confirmation of inferred direction may be enough. If the user explicitly asks you to decide, state the chosen assumption and proceed proportionately.

## Step 4 — select tools by taste + need, not trend
Read `UI-AND-CODEBASE-TOOLS.md` only when a related capability is relevant. Examples:
- Minimal/editorial, fast, content-led interface → first try the existing stack, semantic HTML/CSS, and design tokens; no new library may be needed.
- React/Next.js component-heavy UI with matching polished motion cards or interactive elements → consider Aceternity UI only if its style/prerequisites fit.
- Liquid, ripple, particle, shader or procedural canvas effect → consider Canvas UI; otherwise use simpler CSS/SVG.
- A true authored 3D scene that serves the product → consider Spline.
- A real custom GPU/WebGPU/WGSL or compute requirement → consider VGPU. Never use low-level GPU rendering just to add a fashionable glow.
- Large/unfamiliar codebase mapping → optionally evaluate Understand Anything based on codebase complexity, not on visual taste.

Never present all tools as an automatic bundle. Suggest at most the few choices that add clear value, explain why, and name a simpler alternative where reasonable.

## Step 5 — approval and implementation
- Ask before adding dependencies, external services, persistent skills, plugins, or installing third-party code.
- Do not install all reference tools as a preset.
- Make a small vertical slice first, then check whether the result matches the accepted direction.
- Preserve accessibility, responsiveness, reduced-motion preferences, usable semantic text/actions, loading states, graceful fallbacks, and the project's design system.
- Validate against the user's references and acceptance criteria. If the implementation drifts from the agreed taste, revise it rather than defending the tool choice.

## Non-negotiable rules
- Never code a substantial new visual direction before asking about taste when the user has not supplied a clear preference/reference.
- Never recommend a tool before understanding the relevant design goal and inspecting stack constraints.
- Never mistake aesthetic assumptions for user-approved decisions.
- Never claim a design/reference/website was inspected if it was not actually accessible.
- Be direct and lightweight: discovery should help the user decide, not become a lengthy intake interview.
