# OpenCode Setup Notes

## Discovery
- Root AGENTS.md provides repository instructions.
- .agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md is a supported project-local skill location. Skills load on demand; they are not all executed for every message.
- `.opencode/agents/<name>.md` defines custom subagents. Available focused roles include `@planner`, `@designer`, `@service-strategist`, `@reviewer`, and `@verifier`. The primary agent should route to a specialist when its domain is explicitly part of the user request; do not invoke all specialists for every task. Actual activation depends on the active OpenCode host/model and its available task tools.

## UCA Kit role and skill routing

Read `AGENT-SKILL-MAP.md` only when routing is ambiguous or cross-functional; read `HOST-CAPABILITY-FALLBACK.md` only when a native skill, agent, hook or usage API is absent or uncertain. For a combined visual design + business/service-offering plan, the primary agent should use `@designer` and `@service-strategist`, then synthesize one plan. If the request is about a backend/API service instead, choose `backend-api` and the relevant Python/database skills; involve the designer only when UI work is also requested. Always tell the user which skills are selected, read those actual skill files, and avoid loading every skill by default.

## Local usage meter and subagent budget guard

The OpenCode profile installs `.opencode/plugins/uca-usage.mjs` and `scripts/uca-usage.cjs`. The plugin is designed to record finalized message token metadata locally, count calls made through supported task/subagent hooks, consult the configured local budget before those optional calls, and show local threshold/budget-block toast warnings. It stores aggregate counters only; it does not store prompts, outputs, message IDs, code, or credentials and has no UCA Kit telemetry endpoint.

Configure caps and a conservative per-call reservation (these are examples; choose values for your model/plan):

```bash
node scripts/uca-usage.cjs budget --max-total-tokens 20000 --max-agent-calls 4 --max-cost-usd 0.50 --planned-agent-tokens 1500 --planned-agent-cost-usd 0.03
node scripts/uca-usage.cjs show
```

OpenCode may report token usage and a cost value; the plugin keeps token counters as host-reported and cost as estimated rather than treating it as an invoice. The plugin's CI test simulates the event payload and budget block; it does not replace a real test in your installed OpenCode version. After installation, reload OpenCode, run a short test task, then confirm that `node scripts/uca-usage.cjs show` changes as expected. If the host's event/hook shapes differ, disable the plugin and report the mismatch rather than trusting incomplete numbers.

**Limitations:** this is an OpenCode-specific adapter, not a universal interceptor. Other IDEs remain manual/unmetered until their own supported usage/hook adapters are implemented. The ledger is local by default; hosted model providers still receive the request needed to generate answers. Full privacy from the model provider requires a suitably configured local/self-hosted model. See `USAGE-PRIVACY.md`.

## Free models
This pack intentionally does not hard-code a model ID. Run opencode models or use /models to see available models through configured providers. Choose one with reliable tool calling and enough context for the repository. Free-tier availability and limits can change.

## Temperature
Planner/reviewer/verifier use temperature 0.1 for focused output. This is not a truth guarantee. Model/provider support varies. If the provider rejects the setting, remove it or use its documented option. Lower temperature does not eliminate hallucinations.

## Suggested loop
1. Ask the primary agent to inspect and plan.
2. Implement one small vertical slice.
3. Ask @reviewer to inspect the actual diff.
4. Ask @verifier to assess tests and unverified claims.
5. Run relevant checks and inspect their outputs.
6. Fix confirmed issues and verify again.

Agent roles and skills improve consistency; they do not guarantee correctness. Repository inspection, tests, independent review, and deployment checks remain necessary.

## Impeccable UI design checks
For frontend/UI projects, install Impeccable separately from the project root:

    npx impeccable install

Choose OpenCode and project scope in the installer, then reload OpenCode. In the agent chat, run /impeccable init. Full instructions and detector commands are in IMPECCABLE-SETUP.md.

Impeccable checks for known UI anti-patterns and design quality issues; it does not reliably detect whether code was authored by AI. Its deterministic detector can run without an LLM/API key:

    npx impeccable detect src/

Run this only if the project has the relevant UI source directory. For a running page, use its actual local URL, e.g. npx impeccable detect http://localhost:3000. Do not report success unless the command was actually run.
